One of the most promising applications of AI is in the detection of fraud. Last year, MasterCard announced that it will employ AI to improve real-time approvals and reduce false declines. Javelin Strategy & Review estimated that the value of false-declines is thirteen times greater than the amount lost in actual credit card fraud and is a major source of frustration for customers. Using AI to lower the number of false-declines would be a major benefit for many card users. AI is also being used to help everyday investors earn more money. Automated investment service Betterment uses AI to reduce "tax drag" and boost users' earnings an estimated 15% over 30 years. The service constantly calculates the most tax-efficient ratio of stocks and bonds, as well as the most advantageous taxable account (traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA, etc) in which to put those investments.
